Ethans Scenario: Using the application to get assistance in studying for a test.

Ethan is a freshman college student studying Computer Science. He is preparing for his first programming test but is unsure of exactly what of the documents he should be studying.
Ethan uses our application to find other students who have taken the course before to see if any of them can give him tips on what specific areas to study for the test. The previous students then can provide Ethan with their old flash cards and what modules to look  over before the test.
