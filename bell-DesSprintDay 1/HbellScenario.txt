Harrison's Scenario: Using the application to get assistance in studying for a test.

Ethan is a freshman college student studying Computer Science. He is preparing for his first programming test but is unsure of exactly what of the documents he should be studying. Ethan uses our application to find other students who have taken the course before to see if any of them can give him tips on what specific areas to study for the test. The previous students then can provide Ethan with their old flash cards and what modules to look over before the test.

First person story: I need help with studying for this test. I log onto this application and ask if wnyone has taken this class before and can help me with studying for this test. My message gets sent to people who have taken the class before and they send me good advice for what they did to study for the test as well as some study cards and notes, after I finished the class I was able to do the same for another student.
