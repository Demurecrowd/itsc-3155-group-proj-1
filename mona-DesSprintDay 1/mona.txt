I am a student at uncc in his first year. Im a computer science major and am looking for new ways to improve my learning experience and a type of guide to help me through college.
I used this website to help me learn more about computer science and guide myself on how to make myself more marketable to jobs throughout my college career. 
It has so many features like the ability to see tips from past alumni and a guide to finding out how to progress in the place I am currently in.
